## Description

I will plot some statistics about COVID-19 using the Johns Hopkins University github repo:  https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19

Those guys are doing a great job with daily updates of confirmed cases, deaths, etc. So its a matter of pulling their data daily.

I will be using the latest data set to the date, namely that of the 26th of March 2020.

On the first tab, the number of confirmed, recovered, and death cases by selected country. On the second tab, a forecast for the next ten days using an exponential smoothing state space model (ets) from the forecast package.
